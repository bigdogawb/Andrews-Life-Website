<p>I'm a person who has always loved computers since I was a child. Exploring the internet and watching other peoples videos and browsing others conent was my childhood. I also was a big fan of video games, I especially like to play Minecraft and Nintendo games. As I grew older I wanted to be one of the people who created things online, so I began learing the basics of coding, hoping one day to make my own games and websites. Now I'm less intreasted in doing that as a career but I enjoy it in my free time as a hobby.</p>
